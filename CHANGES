0.17 - Inheritable ACE's should be respected unless they are marked inherit only

0.16 - Fix problem where a request for a directory not including a trailing / did
       not correctly look for index files. Now a / is always inserted between the
       directory and the potential index file; while this will result in a double
       / for requests which already include a trailing /, that seems less
       inefficient than checking every request for a trailing / and conditionally
       adding it.

0.15 - Add support for directory indexes

0.10 - First publicly released version
